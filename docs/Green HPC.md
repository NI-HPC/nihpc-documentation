# Green HPC: Sustainable Use of High Performance Computing

Green HPC refers to using high-performance computing systems in a carbon-efficient way, aiming to minimize environmental impact. Every user of Kelvin2 can contribute to reducing emissions by following sustainable computing practices. 


## Best Practices for Carbon-Efficient HPC Use

**1. Run Only Meaningful Jobs**

   Before submitting any job, ensure it will generate valuable results. Avoid running calculations without a clear understanding of their purpose or relevance to your research. 

  

**2. Test Before Scaling**

   Always test input files and job scripts using small or short jobs before scaling up. 

   - Use the `k2-sandbox` queue for initial testing. 

   - This reduces the number of failed or cancelled jobs—preventing unnecessary carbon emissions. 

  

**3. Optimize Job Design**

   Consider whether your project goals can be achieved with fewer jobs. For instance: 

   - Refine sampling strategies when exploring parameter spaces. 

   - Use more efficient algorithms where possible. 

  

## Sustainability First: Avoiding Emissions Is Best 

As with many areas of sustainability, the most effective approach is carbon abatement—not emitting carbon in the first place. Efficient HPC use reduces the need for offsetting emissions after they occur.
